Problems

 - how to store test files: DB for now
 - how to determine timeout for a test suite
 - how to allocate enough time to all test runs?
 	 Timeout based on wall clock time. What if server is overloaded and a test doesn't get time to run?
 	 	- emit metric for total cpu time taken when timeout occurs.
 	 	- metric for total CPU consumption
 - scalability
 	- make test runs faster:
 		- reduce startup time for test runs
 		- py server that takes code file as input and maintains test objects in a cache
